# angular2-webpack2

Angular 2 Webpack 2 minimal starter. Includes both unit and e2e tests.

## Project scripts

### Install packages
The only think you need when when you have prerequisites installed is to run:
```
npm install
```

### Custom scripts 

Running in dev mode:
```
npm run dev
```

Running prod build:
```
npm run build
```

Running unit tests:
```
npm test
```

Running e2e tests:
```
npm run e2e
```

## Prerequisites

### NodeJS with npm

#### Mac OS X
If you don't have [Brew](http://brew.sh) it is high time to install it:
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Then just run:
```
brew install node
```

#### Debian and Ubuntu
```
sudo apt-get install nodejs
```

#### Windows

[Windows NodeJS Installer](http://nodejs.org/#download)


### Note for Windows users: install Python 2 (to run tests)

This one is built-in when using Mac OS X and Linux. When you run Windows you have to care of it by yourself. Here's [offical Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
